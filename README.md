This is a very good for starting expandable entity/npc system (including enemies mechanics). I highly recommend changing some of my code to match your project's style and gameplay mechanics.

*IMPORTANT (management):
- Header files (.h) are located in **'/Public/'**
- Source files (.cpp) are located in **'/Private/'**
